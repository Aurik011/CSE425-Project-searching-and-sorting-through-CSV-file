# CSE425-Project-searching-and-sorting-through-CSV-file-

## TASK 
For this assignment first we had to search and sort through the CSV file(heart.csv) which
was given by our honourable faculty. To search and sort we used Python, Shell Script and
C++ languages. As for searching we need to select which column we want to search and
give any number as input which belongs to the column of the CSV file else it will show
invalid. In the sorting part, we sort column wise and in ascending order. The entire CSV
file consists of 304 rows(including column name) and 14 columns. After successfully
implementing our final task was to compare between the languages we used for search
and sorting , which we did below.

## IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
### Python: 
An interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language . The use of
significant indentation in its design philosophy emphasizes code readability. Its language
constructs and object-oriented approach are aimed at assisting programmers in writing clear,
logical code for both small and large-scale projects.

### Shell Script: 
It is basically designed to run in Unix shell, a command-line interpreter.
Shell scripts come in a variety of dialects, which are referred to as scripting languages.
Shell scripts can perform a variety of tasks, including file manipulation, program
execution, and text printing.

### C++: 
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created as an extension of the C
programming language, or "C with Classes".It was designed with an orientation toward
system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems,
with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.
